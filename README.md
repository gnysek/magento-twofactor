JetRails® Two Factor
=============================
Two Factor is a Magento extension that enables two factor authentication login for Magento admin users.  This extension is meant to be used with authentication apps such as __Google Authenticator__ or __Authy__.

Installation
=============================
To install this extension, simply download the archive file in __dist__ and upload it to your staging server. Once uploaded, move it into your store's installation directory (i.e. /var/www/html/magento).  Finally, uncompress said archive file.  This will copy the extension's files into the Magento file system.  Log in as admin and navagate to _System > Configuration_ and you will see the _JETRAILS®_ panel on the left hand side.  In said panel click on the extension name.  If a 404 message is displayed, simply logout and log back in.

Build System
=============================
All JetRails® extensions use __Grunt__ as a build system.  Grunt is a package that can be easily downloaded using __NPM__.  Once this repository is cloned, run `npm install grunt -g` followed by `npm install` to install Grunt and all Grunt modules used within this build system.  Please refer to the following table for a description of some useful grunt build commands. A typical grunt command takes the following form: `grunt task:argument`.

| Task       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `init`     | Initializes the file structure. Creates __lib__ and __dist__.  An argument can be passed in order to create a custom directory (i.e. `grunt init:new` will create a folder called _new_).       |
| `nuke`     | Removes all folders generated by __init__.  An argument can be passed to delete a folder (i.e. `grunt nuke:new` will delete the folder _new_).                                                  |
| `version`  | Updates the version number in all __php__ and __xml__ files with the one defined in __package.json__.                                                                                           |
| `metadata` | This will update/attach the __php__ class comment header with updated information found in __package.json__.  It will also insert a comment header for uncommented functions.                   |
| `resolve`  | Will download all dependencies found in __package.json__ under the _jetrailsDependencies_ attribute.  Module source will be packaged with the source contents of these dependencies.            |
| `release`  | This command first runs __init__ and then __resolve__.  It then compresses the source and dependencies and outputs the archive in __dist__.  This command gets the repo ready for a git commit. |
| `deploy`   | Will upload dependencies and source code to a staging server.  Credentials to this server can be configured in the __package.json__ file under the _staging_ attribute.                         |
| `stream`   | Will watch the __lib__ and __src__ folders for any changes. Once a change occurs it will run the __deploy__ task.                                                                               |
|            | The default task is aliased to run the __release__ task.                                                                                                                                        |
